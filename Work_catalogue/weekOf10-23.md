We had our second meeting to discuss project workload, and we set up goals.
Submitted our project proposal and our schedule for the assignment.

Yamm:
    Finished the database setup, and the basic frontend / Backend API. As well as a basic rendering frontend reading data from the backend.
    Setup branches so everyone can work in non-conflicting environments.
